  [Improvements]
  - aliases can accept an array reference.

  - Return empty string for 0-byte files instead of empty style
    element, but warn.

  [Bug Fixes]
  - If an alias points to a URI, then link_or_inline_html and
    deferred_link_html will return the link_html.

  - link_or_inline_html didn't skip duplicate aliases.

  [Documentation]
  - Added more examples to POD.

v0.2.0    2020-02-20 17:37:47+00:00 Europe/London
  [Improvements]
  - Allows "1" as an alias when the filename is the same as the name.
    (You can use "1.css" if that is the name of the file.)

  - False ("0", "" or undef) aliases are ignored. (You can use "0.css"
    if that is the name of the file.)

  - link_or_inline_html can accept a list of aliases.

  [Bug Fixes]
  - Use the dist_share instead of the module_share. (Basically,
    defer_link_html did not work outside of tests.)

v0.1.2    2020-02-19 21:38:14+00:00 Europe/London
