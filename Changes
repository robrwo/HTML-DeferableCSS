  [Improvements]
  - Allows "1" as an alias when the filename is the same as the name.
    (You can use "1.css" if that is the name of the file.)

  - False ("0", "" or undef) aliases are ignored. (You can use "0.css"
    if that is the name of the file.)

  - link_or_inline_html can accept a list of aliases.

  [Bug Fixes]
